# Image gallery test assignment

The app is developed and tested on the iPhone. So IOS is preferable for testing,
But it should work with Android just as fine, maybe with some minor visual defects

## To install the project

1. Clone it with git
2. Run from the root folder:

```
npm i
```

## Start the project

The project is written using `expo`. To start the project on your phone [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app should be preinstalled.

Run from the root folder:

```
npm start
```

Then scan the QR code in a terminal with your camera

## Troubleshooting

When starting the project with `npm start` it might throw the following error:

> It looks like you're trying to use TypeScript but don't have the required dependencies installed.

If you faced such an error just try to update `expo-cli` with the latest version

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```
